---

## The Data Scientist's Toolbox

* Overview and motivation of Data Science Specialization
* Intro to Git and GitHub
* Intro to R and Rstudio
* Not much more than a set-up guide

---

## R Programming

* Basics of the R language
* Guided R Programming Exercises via swirl (community-generated tutorial)
* Two computer graded programming assignments
    + Write three R functions to generate statistics on data set
    + Write three R functions to rank hospitals based on data set 
* One peer assessed programming assignment 
* Foundation to remaining courses (if not familiar with R)
* Good start, but not enough to feel comfortable in R

---

## Getting and Cleaning Data

* Transforming raw, messy data into tidy data
* What is "tidy data?"
    + One observation per row and one variable per column
* Working with multiple file and data formats
    + CSV, XML, JSON, HDF5
* Reading data from various sources
    + Websites, APIs, mySQL databases
* Manipulating data in R
    + subsetting, sorting, reshaping, merging
* Text formatting with regular expressions
* Considered very useful, would love more of these techniques

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

* Principles of Analytic Graphics, see work by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)
* Visualizations through basic R plotting packages 
* Clustering, dimension reduction, handling missing values

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, main = "mtcars data set")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, main = "mtcars data set")
```

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, main = "mtcars data set")
g <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(drat, wt))
g + geom_point(aes(color = mpg), size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
#qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, geom = c("point", "smooth"))
set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(12, mean = rep(1:3, each = 4), sd = 0.2)
y <- rnorm(12, mean = rep(c(1, 2, 1), each = 4), sd = 0.2)
dataFrame <- data.frame(x, y)
kmeansObj <- kmeans(dataFrame, centers = 3)
plot(x, y, col = kmeansObj$cluster, pch = 19, cex = 2)
points(kmeansObj$centers, col = 1:3, pch = 3, cex = 3, lwd = 3)
```

## Reproducible Research

* Principles and motivation for creating reproducible research
* From code to "published" papers
    + R Markdown -> knitr -> RPubs

## Statistical Inference

* More significant math compared to other courses
    + Probability
    + Conditional Probability, Bayes' Rule
    + Hypothesis Testing
    + Confidence Intervals
    + Error Rates
* Course material appears to change more than other courses
    + previously only quizes
* "weed-out course"

---

## Regression Models

* Continuation of Statistical Inference
    + Linear Regression, Residuals, Prediction Intervals, Multivariate Regression, 
    + Model Comparison, Generalized Regression Models
* Course project: statistical analysis paper on simple dataset

---

## Practical Machine Learning

* Quick overview of machine learning
* Easy to use tools (R packages) for machine learning
* Could lead someone to "danger zone"


---

## Developing Data Products

* Overly verbose lectures, fun project
* Several Examples on Twitter: #myDataProduct



---

## Data Science Capstone

* October 27 - December 15
